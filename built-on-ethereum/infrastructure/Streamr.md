## About
Streamr provides a complete system to tokenize the value of real-time data to enable a new way for machines and people to trade it on a decentralised P2P network. The Streamr Network is a decentralised peer-to-peer (P2P) network. It is used to transport real-time data from data producers to data consumers. 

## DATAcoin
Using the services of the Network - publishing and subscribing to data - requires a small amount of DATA tokens, consumed as fees. The fees will be earned by nodes which form the Network and provide the data transport service. This incentivises people to run nodes in the Network, offering them a way to monetise their idle bandwidth.
The token also represents value in the data content. The Streamr Marketplace allows data producers to receive payments in DATAcoin for a data license and permissions to access and use the data. Access to data can be traded on the Marketplace by companies, organisations, individuals, and machines, offering a novel monetisation mechanism for data content. The token will probably have more complicated uses too, related to staking and reputation mechanisms at play within the P2P network. The details regarding these will only be discovered much further into the project.

## Work with Golem

"We believe cooperation is key and to that extent we’ve hung out with and befriended the team behind Golem, to the degree that we now share R&D resources. Golem’s decentralised computing platform shares a lot of P2P with us. We’re better off solving them together." - https://www.streamr.com/faq#vision
