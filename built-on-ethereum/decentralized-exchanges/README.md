# Decentralized Exchanges

## Summary

Decentralized Exchanges \(sometimes referred to as 'non-custodial exchanges'\) allow for the trading of crypto assets without the need for a trusted central authority. This cuts down on the risk of exchange hacks and many other risks. There are many types of decentralized exchanges and it's important to understand the differences.
