# Pre-History

## October 2017, Devcon3 in Cancun

Vitalik Buterin presents ["Modest proposal for Ethereum 2.0"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAhUfCjjkXc), suggesting that Layer 1 of Ethereum 1.0 should stay “safe and conservative”, and most of the innovation go into Layer 2 and into shards.

## May 2018, EDCON in Toronto

Vitalik Buterin gives a talk [“So you want to become Casper validator?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOlOMAqC08), signalling that Casper FFG validators may be running on laptops and rollout is getting close.

## June 2018

Pivot in Casper research from Casper FFG to full Casper and merging with sharding, due to challenges of implementing Casper FFG as a contract, and due to large overlap with Sharding research, as discussed at the [Core Dev Meeting 40](https://youtu.be/8-AZys80RrU?t=1819).

## October-November 2018, Devcon IV in Prague

It becomes apparent that Serenity \(full Casper + Sharding\) is not going to functionally supersede Ethereum 1.0 for another 3-5 years.
