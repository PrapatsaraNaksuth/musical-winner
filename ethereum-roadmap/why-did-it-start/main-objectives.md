# Main Objectives

## Overview

* Develop, formalise, and implement set of measures, deployable on the Ethereum 1.0 mainnet, within the next 2 years, to ensure that the chain stays viable and usable. That mainly means curbing the state growth or limiting the state size.
* Emphasize focus on these measures and de-emphasize introduction of specific “features”. This is one of the places where eWASM engine comes in. Current computational pre-compiles are seen as features requiring case-by-case work. Introduction of eWASM engine would first enable “pre-compile” factory, where more pre-compiles are introduced faster. Later it would enable any contracts written in eWASM, obviating need in pre-compiles altogether.
