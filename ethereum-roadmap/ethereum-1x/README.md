# Ethereum 1.x

## Summary

A group of Ethereum core developers and friends talked at Devcon IV and realised that they all share similar view - that Ethereum mainnet, if left unchanged, would become very hard or impossible to use due to severe performance degradation, and increased storage requirements.

* Performance degradation mostly due to the large \(and increasing\) state.
* Increased storage requirements mostly due to keeping blocks, event logs \(receipts\), and state history \(currently prunable in major clients\).
