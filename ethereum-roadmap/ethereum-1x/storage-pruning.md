# Storage Pruning

## The questions to be answered are:

* What do we absolutely have to keep to comply with the Ethereum protocol?
* Do we always need to keep all the blocks? \(maybe not, if we use backward sync, for example\)
* Do we need to keep receipts, or just logs, how much \(in Gb\), or for how long?
* Do we need to always download the entire header chain or can we compress it \(with STARK proofs for example\)?
* Can we improve snapshot sync procedures \(fast sync, warp sync\) so that they prevent invalid state transitions \(with Validity Proofs, for example\)?
