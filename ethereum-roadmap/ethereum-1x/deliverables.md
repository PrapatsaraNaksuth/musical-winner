## Measures requiring hard-forks:

* State rent \(or state growth limiting\)
* Ewasm

## Measures likely not requiring hard-forks, but requiring client code coordination on the network protocol:

* Storage pruning

Simulation and Emulation group produces data for making projections, benchmarks, and parameter calibrations for other groups.
