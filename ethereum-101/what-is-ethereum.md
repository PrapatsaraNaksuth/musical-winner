# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based computing system. Leveraging smart contract \(scripting\) technology, anyone is able to build and deploy decentralized applications on top of Ethereum.

Ether is the fundamental cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum network. It is used to compensate miners for performing transactions on the network. Ether can also be used to transfer value from one account on the network to another.
