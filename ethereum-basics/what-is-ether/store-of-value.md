# Store of Value

## What gives Ether value?

Ether, the native currency of the Ethereum network, derives its value from a myriad of different factors. It is used within the Ethereum network to perform a range of functions, including:

used to pay Ethereum transaction fees \(in the form of ‘gas’\) used as collateral for a wide range of open finance applications \(MakerDAO, Compound\) can be lent or borrowed \(Dharma\) accepted as payment at certain retailers and service providers used to as a medium of exchange to purchase Ethereum-based tokens \(via ICOs or exchanges\), crypto-collectibles, in-game items, and other non-fungible tokens \(NFTs\) earned as a reward for completing bounties \(Gitcoin, Bounties Network\) Furthermore, in Ethereum 2.0 \(Serenity\), users will be able to become a validator and help secure the network by providing computational resources and locking up 32 Ether per validator. Due to this, it is expected that Proof of Stake will lock a substantial amount of the circulating supply of Ether. There are also discussions around introducing a ‘fee-burn’ model where a percentage of Ether used to pay transaction fees would be ‘burned’ and thus reduce the circulating supply of Ether.

In addition to utility value, Ether also has speculative value. This is value that is derived from speculative activities \(such as trading and investing\) which currently accounts for most of the value behind all crypto-assets. As observed in 2017, crypto-assets can attract substantial speculative interest, with some assets increasing in value by 1000x over just a few months. This speculative interest often brings fresh capital into the ecosystem that can be reinvested into various verticals, but it can be damaging to the short-term market sentiment of all crypto-assets.

## Can’t tokens on Ethereum be used instead of Ether?

Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The concept of using another asset to secure the Ethereum network is called ‘economic abstraction’ \(a good primer can be found [here](https://docs.ethhub.io/questions-about-ethereum/is-ether-needed-for-transaction-fees). This would involve miners / validators accepting tokens other than Ether in exchange for adding valid transactions to new blocks.

It is highly unlikely that the Ethereum protocol will ever implement economic abstraction as it could potentially reduce the security of the blockchain by compromising the value of Ether.

## How does valuable Ether help to secure the network?

In Proof of Work systems, miners compete with each other to find a block and thus be rewarded for their work \(in the form of the native crypto-asset of the protocol\). As the price of the asset increases, it naturally brings with it more miners, which then increases the network difficulty. As the network difficulty increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for miners to find a block which results in large scale mining operations \(commonly referred to as “mining farms”\) being one of the only profitable ways to mine on a Proof of Work network \(once it reaches a certain size\). Miners can also join ‘mining pools’ in order to increase their chances of finding a block and thus increase their rewards.

It would currently cost an individual or group a large amount of money to successfully attack or take control of either the Bitcoin or Ethereum PoW blockchains.

When Ethereum transitions to Proof of stake under Ethereum 2.0, it is expected that users will be able to stake 32 Ether per validator and receive rewards for their work in the form of additional Ether \(at a dynamic issuance rate , discussed later in this essay\).

Under Proof of Stake, the cost of attacking Ethereum will be tied to the cost of Ether. Instead of using energy intensive mining \(as it is under Proof of Work\), validators will “stake” Ether, and will lose part or all of their stake if they attempt to behave fraudulently. The more validators with staked Ether securing the network, the more Ether an attacker would need to purchase in order to carry out an attack. Such an attack would likely rapidly increase the price of Ether and thus make it prohibitively more expensive for the attacker.
