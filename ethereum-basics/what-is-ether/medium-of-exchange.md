# Medium of Exchange

Ether is used as a medium of exchange within the Ethereum economy for a wide range of apps, with dapp providers accepting it in exchange for fungible / non-fungible tokens, or other services. It is also used as a unit of account by various parties (including companies that have raised Ether via ICOs). Finally, Ether has historically been used as a store of value, with investors and speculators purchasing Ether to hold for investment purposes, given its relative scarcity, predictable supply growth, and inherent utility.

An object (physical or digital) must typically exhibit five distinct attributes in order to be considered money: fungibility, durability, portability, divisibility and established history (see the [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)).
Ether is highly portable (because it’s digital), durable (again, because it’s digital), divisible (up to 8 decimal places), but has limited fungibility (ETH tokens are interchangeable with one another, but accounts/addresses can be blacklisted quite easily. Privacy protocols such as zk-SNARKs will eventually improve this property for Ethereum).

While the Ethereum network is only 3 and a half years old, it continues to build a strong established history. The Ethereum network (and Ether) have so far survived The DAO, multiple large hacks of smart contracts, multiple protocol-level exploits, the Shanghai DoS attacks, constant negative remarks from the wider crypto community and multiple bear markets (including a current 94% drop in price).

On top of this, Ether has additional properties such as being censorship-resistant, permissionless, pseudonymous and interoperable with other crypto-networks.

The supply scheme of crypto-assets is hotly debated among various parties (especially those in the Bitcoin community) and there are currently two main approaches: a capped supply (like Bitcoin) or a low, predictable and hard to change issuance rate (like what is planned for Ethereum 2.0).

There is currently no concrete answer to which approach is better. A capped supply suffers from the fact that once the protocol stops issuing new coins in the form of block rewards, it’s up to users paying a sufficient amount of network fees to incentivize miners to secure the network. This may or may not be sufficient to secure the Bitcoin network in the future.

In Ethereum 2.0 (with Sharding and Proof of Stake implemented), while a low inflation rate will always guarantee the validators are rewarded for securing the network, it suffers from the fact that it dilutes the value of ether for those that are not validators (if the Ethereum economy does not grow more than the issuance rate).
