## Summary

Relentless, formerly known as Zombie Battleground, is a Magic: The Gathering-style collectible card game that stores all of your game assets and data on its own dedicated Plasma DAppChain.

Since the cards are stored on the Blockchain as non-fungible \(ERC721\) tokens, not only can a player prove that they own their cards — they can even sell or trade them with anyone for actual money.

## History

### Backer Alpha

Relentless is currently in Alpha version available for backers on Android, iOS, Mac and Windows. The earliest Alpha build was released in August 2018.

### Kickstarter

On June 14, 2018, the Zombie Battleground kickstarter was launched with an initial goal of $250,000 USD. It raised an amazing $165k in the first day, reached the full goal in 20 days, and ended up raising over $320,000 USD.

### Binance promotion

Loom has [partnered with the Binance](https://loom.games/en/binance-promo/) exchange to accept BNB for new packs and created a collectors-edition of the cards for BNB users. Additionally, there is an exclusive "Funds are SAFU" card available.
