## Summary

Etherbots is a robot battling game with rock-paper-scissors style battles that launched in March 2018. An Etherbot can be assembled from 4 parts, one body, melee, defense, and turrett. Battles are one-on-one asynchronous on-chain events.

## History

## Etherbots 2

While [Gods Unchained](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/games/gods-unchained) is the main focus in the short term, an edition of Etherbots 2 is expected after a successful launch of GU.

## Gods Unchained crossover

[Gods Unchained](https://docs.ethhub.io/built-on-ethereum/games/gods-unchained) is a trading card game also created by the Immutable team. The team showed another innovation on the blockchain by bringing the game assets from Etherbots into Gods Unchained to be limited edition cards for those players.
