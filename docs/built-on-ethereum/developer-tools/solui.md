## About

solUI - _"solly"_ - lets you quickly generate a Dapp for your smart contracts and deploy it to IPFS with a shareable URL anyone can use. No frontend coding required - just write a JSON specification and check it into version control alongside your contracts. This way your Dapp is never out-of-sync with your contract code.
