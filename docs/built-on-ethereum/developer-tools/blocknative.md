## Description
Help your Dapp users get onboard and easily transact. Blocknative builds tools to improve blockchain UX. Our first product, **Blocknative Assist** is an embeddable widget that improves Dapp transaction usability. It programmatically identifies and outlines clear actions for end-users to follow when interacting with MetaMask to overcome — and even prevent — common pitfalls and obstacles. 

Integrating Assist.js with your Dapp is a straightforward process – and well documented! Once integrated, Assist will immediately and measurably improve the usability of your Dapp. 

Blocknative Assist is broken out into four primary capabilities, which can be mixed, matched, or totally isolated – so you and your team are always in control.
