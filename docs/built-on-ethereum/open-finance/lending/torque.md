# Torque

## Summary

Torque, the first borrowing platform with indefinite-term loans and fixed interest rates. Torque is uniquely both an App and a dApp. Torque works with any web3 wallet like Metamask, Dapper, Nifty, & co., but it also works with every other type of wallet. This is enabled by Torqueâ€™s first-of-its-kind ENS loan system which allows users to borrow assets by simply sending collateral to a human-readable ENS domain from any wallet. Best of all, it does this without requiring any accounts or charging any fees. The bZx base protocol was successfully [audited by ZK Labs](https://github.com/mattdf/audits/blob/master/bZx/bzx-audit.pdf).

## Collateral Types

DAI, ETH, WBTC, LINK, ZRX, REP and KNC tokens could be used as collateral.
