# Burner Wallet

## Summary

Founded by [Austin Griffith](https://twitter.com/austingriffith), The Burner Wallet runs on the xDai sidechain from POA. Since it is in DAI, a dApp can simply refer to amounts in USD. Plus, block times take 5 seconds and gas costs are virtually abstracted because they are so cheap and paid in DAI. Finally, the bridge between xDai and DAI/ETH is as simple as sending tokens to a specific address.

### What is the xDai Chain?

The xDai Chain is an Ethereum-based blockchain that uses USD-stable XDAI \(a representation of DAI token\) as the native coin of the network. xDai Chain will be fast and cost efficient, using Proof-of-Authority consensus model and having 5 second block times.

### What is XDAI?

XDAI is the USD-stable coin that is a representation of DAI but lives on xDai Chain, instead of Ethereum mainnet. XDAI is the native coin on xDai Chain and is used as the currency and for transaction fees on the network. You can use the [TokenBridge](https://dai-bridge.poa.network/) to convert Dai from Ethereum Mainnet to xDai on xDai Chain
