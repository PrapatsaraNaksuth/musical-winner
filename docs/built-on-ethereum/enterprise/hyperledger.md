# Hyperledger

## Summary
Hyperledger is an umbrella organization – cast in the image of the Linux Foundation – for open source blockchain development, comprising a number of protocols designed specifically for enterprises.<br/>

Hyperledger has many projects backed by big organizations such as 'Fabric' backed by **IBM** and 'Sawtooth' backed by **Intel Corporation**. Both Intel and IBM worked on these projects first and then presented them to Hyperledger for acceptance into the Incubator. That resulted into these projects growing at a tremendous rate and now are among the top frameworks for enterprise blockchain networks. Fabric supports EVM based smart contracts, it also has a web3 provider which can be used to develop dApps using web3.js.

Sawtooth also supports Ethereum through **Seth**, Sawtooth's Ethereum-compatible Transaction Processor. It implements a Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) so Seth can run Ethereum Dapps written in Solidity.
