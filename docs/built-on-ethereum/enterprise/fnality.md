## Summary
Fnality (Formerly known as Utility Settlement Coin (USC)), the newly rechristened U.K.-based project is developing blockchain versions of five major fiat currencies: the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the euro. It has $63.2 million in fresh funding from 14 banks. Fnality's tech partner, Clearmatics, is building these systems on a private version of ethereum called **Autonity**.
