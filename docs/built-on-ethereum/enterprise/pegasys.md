## Summary
PegaSys (Protocol Engineering Groups and Systems) is a 50-person team dedicated to enterprise grade blockchain at ConsenSys. It is building Ethereum tech for the public-chain community and leading enterprises focused on privacy, permissioning, scalability, and other features to make Ethereum production-ready.

Pegasys develop open-source software, and are researching next-generation solutions like sidechains and sharding.

Some of the great solutions developed by pegasys are:
