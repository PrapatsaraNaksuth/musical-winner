# Axoni

## Summary
Axoni announced **AxLang**, a new programming language that supports functional programming and enables formal verification of smart contracts for Ethereum-compatible networks.

Solidity has some limitations such as inability to use techniques like formal verification to prove the correctness of smart contract code prior to deploying the contracts on the live network. AxLang goal is to maximize security while enabling broad adoption as much as possible. It is designed to support both public Ethereum as well as private Ethereum projects.
