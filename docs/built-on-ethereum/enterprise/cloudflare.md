description: Cloudflare is building a public Ethereum gateway

# Cloudflare

## Summary
Cloudflare recently announced the Ethereum Gateway - where you can interact with the public Ethereum network without installing any additional software on your computer.

This is another tool in Cloudflareâ€™s Distributed Web Gateway tool set. Currently, Cloudflare lets you host content on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and access it through your own custom domain. Similarly, the new Ethereum Gateway allows access to the public Ethereum network, which you can provision through your custom hostname.

This setup makes it possible to add interactive elements to sites powered by Ethereum smart contracts, a decentralized computing platform. And, in conjunction with the IPFS gateway, this allows hosting websites and resources in a decentralized manner, and has the extra bonus of the added speed, security, and reliability provided by the Cloudflare edge network. You can access our Ethereum gateway directly at [https://www.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/](https://www.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/).
