According to microsoft, "a business person can create a token visually using a design tool that does not involve writing any code whatsoever, and allows them to then say to developers, 'I want one of these.'"

Recently they also released a suite of tools allowing clients to build ethereum-based apps on its cloud computing platform Azure. The new Azure Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum will help developers create and deploy ethereum-based apps on Azure Blockchain Service or the ethereum blockchain.
