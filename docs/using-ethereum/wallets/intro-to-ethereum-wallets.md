# Intro to Ethereum Wallets

Wallets allow Ethereum users to store Ether and to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. There are many different ways to accomplish this. Below is a list of each option and a high level overview of what each option is best for.

## Smart Contract Wallets
[Smart Contract Wallets](smart-contract-wallets.md) are wallets with unique abilities due to the power of smart contract functionality. They enable additional security and recovery features for users.

## Hardware
[Hardware wallets](hardware.md) are the most-secure method for accessing your funds while online, as they do not expose your private key to the internet when signing transactions.

## Mobile
[Phone and other mobile device-based wallets](mobile.md) are mobile alternatives to desktop and web wallets.

## Desktop Wallets
